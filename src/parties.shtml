          <p>
            This is a 45 minute magic and puppet show designed to engage and
            entertain children from 3-10 years. Right from the beginning of the
            show there is fun, laughter, juggling and magic as Michael uses
            his special scanner to find the Birthday boy/girl in the audience.
            They then get to take a staring role in the show and help make the magic
            work with hilarious consequences.
