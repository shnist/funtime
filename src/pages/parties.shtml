      <h2>The Fun Time Magic Show</h2>
      <p>
        This is a 45 minute magic and puppet show designed to engage and
        entertain children from 3-10 years. Right from the beginning of the
        show there is fun, laughter, juggling and magic as Michael uses
        his special scanner to find the Birthday boy/girl in the audience.
        They then get to take a staring role in the show and help make the magic
        work with hilarious consequences.
